# MachineLearning_2021-2022
This repository contains my solutions of laboratories for the course "Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition" held on Polytechnic University of Turin in academic year 2021/2022.

Every folder contains the PDF of the exercise, the .py files and the eventual data files.

Every folder contains the PDF of the exercise and a Keil uVision 5.0 project which needs a LPC1768 board or the equivalent simulator to run.

### Disclaimer:
The solutions proposed work, but haven't been deeply tested and lack of error conditions. <br/>They don't replace teaching material and are just for demonstration purpose.
